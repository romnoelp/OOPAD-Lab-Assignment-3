# OOPAD Lab Assignment 3
## Instructions
Develop a payment application that allows users to place orders for items, define the quantity, unit price, and choose a payment method (GCash, Maya, ShopeePay). The application should calculate the total amount based on the order details and any applicable discounts offered by the chosen payment method, storing the result in the `totalAmount` attribute of the `Order` class.

## Specific Requirements

### PaymentApp class
This class serves as the entry point for the application. It demonstrates how to create an `Order` object, set its properties (`item`, `quantity`, `unit price`, and `payment method`), and calculate the total amount based on the chosen payment method.

### Order class
The application should have an `Order` class that stores information about the ordered item, quantity, unit price, chosen payment method, and the calculated total amount (`totalAmount`).

### PaymentMode interface
The application should implement a `PaymentMode` interface that defines a method for calculating the discount offered by the payment method.

### Concrete implementations of PaymentMode
The application should have concrete implementations of `PaymentMode` for GCash, Maya, ShopeePay:
- **GCash**: Does not offer any discount (discount rate = 0.0)
- **Maya**: Offers a 5% discount (discount rate = 0.05)
- **ShopeePay**: Offers a 10% discount (discount rate = 0.10)

### Functionality
The application should allow users to set the payment method for an order and **calculate the total amount, storing it in the** `totalAmount` **attribute**.

### Sample output: 
Order item is `keyboard`.\
Unit price is `300.0`\
Quantity is `10`

Payment order details if `GCash`\
Discount rate is `0.0`\
Payment amount is `3000.0`

Payment order details if `Maya`\
Discount rate is `0.05`\
Payment amount is `2850.0`

Payment order details if `ShopeePay`\
Discount rate is `0.10`\
Payment amount is `2700.0`
